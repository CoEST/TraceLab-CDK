When operating with multiple monitors, the right click context menu always displays to the left of the arrow on the secondary monitor. It appears that when the jedit window is in the second monitor (to the right in my case) jedit always believes it is approaching the right most margin of the observable area and pushes the menu to the left to keep it visible. Even though in my case this area is still visible. This occurs with jEdit 4.3pre17 on both Windows and Linux.
