I'm using 4.3pre13 on Debian Testing (with Java 1.6.0_04) and on Ubuntu Feisty (with Java 1.5.0_11). I get the same results on both machines. Create the following file, and save it as test.cpp: int a = 1; void bcd() { // } void efg() { // } void hij() { // } Change the folding mode (if necessary) to `indent'. Move the caret to the `hij' line. Press Alt+Backspace to contract the fold. It works. Press Alt+Enter to expand the fold. It works. Press Alt+Enter a second time. The caret moves unexpectedly to the `bcd' line. I think this is a bug: I think the caret should stay where it is, and jEdit should either do nothing or print an error message.
