[notice] jEdit: jEdit version 4.3pre6 When I try to open a file (Ctrl-O) the focus in the filesystembrowser is on the Commands menu instead of the filename field. AFAICT this is because the GUIUtilities.requestFocus() method does not do its job. There was a patch to this method, see rev.5386: http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/jedit/jEdit/trunk/ org/gjt/sp/jedit/GUIUtilities.java?r1=5372&r2=5386 prompted by a bug-report 1275607 http://sourceforge.net/tracker/ index.php?func=detail&aid=1275607&group_id=588&atid=300588 The bug was triggered by something else (find dialog), and the final messages of the bug report indicate that this particular patch was not needed for the bug resolution anyway. So my problem might possibly resolved by simply reverting this patch. (unfortunately, I do not have time to try that here) I don't have an idea about the reason for this bug. Can someone confirm this? cheers, stefan
