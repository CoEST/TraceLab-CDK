I had to do this for a class, so since I fixed it I might as well submit it as a patch. I tried creating a diff, but since I didn't sync it with the jEdit CVS server I was not able to create one. But as it says on your website I will just post it here. *********THE BUG:********* Under the File System Browser, used to open and save files, the Filer textbox doesn't become deselected after it loses focus. To replicate this: 1) Run jEdit 2) Select File->Open 3) Click in the Filter textbox and then click in a different box such as the File Name text box. As you can see the text in the Filter textbox is still selected and/or the caret is still blinking as if it has keyboard focus. *********THE FIX:********* The function protected void processFocusEvent(FocusEvent e) in HistoryComboBoxEditor is where the problem is. HistoryComboBoxEditor is a subclass of org.gjt.sp.jedit.browser.VFSBrowser.java. The correct code is: protected void processFocusEvent(FocusEvent e) { // AWT will call setItem() when the editor loses // focus; that can cause weird and unwanted things // to happen, so ignore lost focus events. if (e.getID() != FocusEvent.FOCUS_LOST) super.processFocusEvent(e); //NEW CODE ADDED BY JAY else { setCaretPosition(0); this.getCaret().setVisible(false); } ///end NEW CODE } This restores the default behavior of what usually happens when the focus is lost. I hope this is helpful to you all.
