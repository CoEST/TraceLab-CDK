A bug seems to have been introduced with revision #16499 which prevents users from printing. Comment from commit: "commit patch #2876132 - get plugin resources from anonymous JARClassLoader" Steps to reproduce: Go to "File" -> "Print" A Dialog appears that says "No print service found.". This has been confirmed on Mac OS X 10.6.2 using Java 6, and Ubuntu using Java 6.
