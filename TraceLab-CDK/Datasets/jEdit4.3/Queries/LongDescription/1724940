If I highlight multiple selections of text in the text area and then begin typing, only the first character of what I type is inserted in the selected areas (except for where the cursor ended up after making the selection). For example if I have the text: <body> <p> Some Text </p> </body> and I highlight both p's in the <p> tags and then type "div" I end up with: <body> <d> Some Text </div> </body> I've attached a screenshot.
