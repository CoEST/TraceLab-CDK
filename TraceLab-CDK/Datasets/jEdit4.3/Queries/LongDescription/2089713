With r13466, sometimes BufferTabs shows wrong icon for Untitled buffer which is dirty. This seems to happen since r13446, or related changes. Reproduction recipe: 1. Open a new buffer. 2. Type 'a'. Now the buffer becomes dirty and DIRTY_CHANGED is sent over EditBus. 3. Type BS. Now the buffer becomes not dirty and DIRTY_CHANGED is sent. 4. Type 'a'. Now the buffer becomes dirty but DIRTY_CHANGED is not sent. Because of this, the icon on BufferTabs remain showing "new", but when I close this buffer, the prompt comes up. Then buffer.isDirty() gives true.
