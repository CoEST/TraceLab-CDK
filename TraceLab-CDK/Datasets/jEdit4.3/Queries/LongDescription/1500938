Hello, this is not a bug, but a wish. As of 4.3pre1, after doing a search (Ctrl-f), when I do another search (Ctrl-f) again, then the previous search expression is not present in the Search dialog anymore. That would actually help in case user wants just to adjust the search expression/regex. thank you for JEdit. Peter
