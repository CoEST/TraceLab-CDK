If you e. g. open build.properties.sample and change the editmode to "properties", then you close that file and then reopen it, you again have to change the editmode manually. This should be done automatically, at least for the files in the recent files list. Sorry if this is a dupe, but I have many bugs to post and am too lazy to check them all for dupes currently. :-) OS: Windows XP Java Version: Sun Java 1.5.0_09-b03 jEdit Version: 4.3pre8
