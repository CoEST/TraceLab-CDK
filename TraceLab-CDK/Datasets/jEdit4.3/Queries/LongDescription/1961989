Both the Tool Bar and Context Menu edit pane should contain a Reset button to get rid of the customizations. Causes: Customizing Tool Bar or Context Menu does override the whole Menu/Tool Bar definition. When jEdit is updated and the old personal settings will be used on, changes of the delivered Context Menu/Tool Bar will be invisible until the customizations are removed from the properties file. Additional, icon assignments for the customized actions of the Tool bar are saved to the properties file. They should be removed too.
