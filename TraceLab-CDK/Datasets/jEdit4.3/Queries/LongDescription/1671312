Hello Thanks again for a wonderful programmers' word processor. In jEdit 4.3pre2, you can quickly add a comma (or anything else) to the end of every line by 1. Press Ctrl-F 2. Check "Regular expressions" 3. Enter $ under 'Search for' 4. Enter , under 'Replace with' 5. Pressing Alt-A The above would match the end of the line, and add a comma to the end. In jEdit 4.3pre9, this does not happen. You have to instead match a character AND the end of the line. If you want to match empty lines, you have to 'Search For' (\n)$ and 'Replace with' ,$1 or $1, but this only has the desired affect for every second line. Using 'Search for' $(\n) and 'Replace with' ,$1 matches all but the last line in the buffer. In jEdit 4.3pre2, $ alone on its own would match the end of the line BEFORE the \n. And this would give the desired effect. Best regards Carlos
