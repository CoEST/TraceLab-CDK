jEdit 4.3pre15 and earlier displayed line, column, and relative position within the text area in the left side of the status bar. jEdit 4.3pre16 also shows offset from the beginning of the file. I find the offset to be distracting. It would be nice if this display could be configurable, so the offset, line number, column number, and relative position could be turned on or off as the user desires.
