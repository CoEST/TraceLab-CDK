Using jEdit development version, SVN rev 9867. When double-clicking an item in the HyperSearch Results window, the corresponding file is opened in a buffer, but the BufferUpdate.LOADED message that is sent when the buffer has been loaded comes with a null view instead of the actual view in which it is opened. The null view causes the SideKick plugin to ignore this message, so it doesn't update its SideKick tree for the buffer (which is now the active buffer).
