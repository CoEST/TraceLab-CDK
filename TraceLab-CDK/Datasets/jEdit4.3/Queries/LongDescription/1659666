patch for perl.xml to handle quote-like operators as documented in http://perldoc.perl.org/perlop.html section Quote-and-Quote-like-Operators. http://perldoc.perl.org/perlop.html#Quote-and-Quote-like-Operators-operator%2c-quote-operator%2c-quote-like-q-qq-qx-qw-m--qr-s-tr-'-''-%22-%22%22-%2f%2f-%60-%60%60-%3c%3c-escape-sequence-escape Without the patch quote-like operators only accepted curly brackets, round brackets, slash or pipe as delimiter. I have a problem with dealing with something like this: eval(q[sub d { my $time=gmtime(); $time=~s/... (...) +(\d+) (........) ..(..)/$2 $1 $4 $3/; print DEBUG "$time <$_[0]>\n"; }]) if $DEBUG; the quote-like operator ends at }] but now jEdit sees $_[0] as the end! Should be fixed by moving some syntax mode code around.
