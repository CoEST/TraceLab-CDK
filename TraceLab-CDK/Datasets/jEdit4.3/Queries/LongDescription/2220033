jEdit 4.3pre16 from svn The relative position display in the status bar is broke. To see the bug: 1. open a file larger than is visible all at once 2. using the down arrow key, scroll down through the file 3. notice that the relative position displays "BOT" well before the bottom of the file 4. continue to scroll completely to the bottom of the file 5. using the up arrow key, scroll up through the file 6. notice that the relative position continues to say "BOT" well up from the bottom of the file
