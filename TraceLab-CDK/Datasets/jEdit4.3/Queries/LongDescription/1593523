If doing "Toggle Tree View" in HyperSearch Results window context menu, it doesn't switch properly, means if switching back to show the path and filename in one line, the path is missing. Sorry if this is a dupe, but I have many bugs to post and am too lazy to check them all for dupes currently. :-) OS: Windows XP Java Version: Sun Java 1.5.0_09-b03 jEdit Version: 4.3pre8
