The editor text area is not properly recognizing Unicode Indic (Sanskrit) input on Windows 2000. I am using the Windows 2000 IME "Sanskrit, Devanagari - INSCRIPT" for inputting the Devanagari (Sanskrit) letters. I am attaching the screenshots of the word "Sanskritam" typed in Windows notepad and the JEdit. The Notepad is displaying the word properly, but the JEdit is not displaying it properly. I am using JDK1.5.0 to Jedit.
