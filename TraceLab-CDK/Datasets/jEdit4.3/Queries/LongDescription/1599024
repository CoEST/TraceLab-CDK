Open the attached textfile that I created with jEdit 4.3pre8. You'll see some squares instead of the Slovak characters. The encoding cp-1250 was used when I created the file and I expect that jEdit will recognize this when I open the file. Perhaps this isn't possible but when I set the buffer encoding manually to cp-1250 the characters are still displayed with the wrong encoding although the status bar tells me that the encoding cp-1250 is now active and used. Besides this bug it would be in general nice to have a menu entry to show opened files in different encodings. This should be like the menu "View -> Character Encoding" in Firefox.
