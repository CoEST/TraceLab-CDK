When re-doing a HyperSearch (from the context menu of a HyperSearch results entry), the title of the last search gets used for the new node. It should use the correct/new title instead, of course. TO REPRODUCE: 1. enable multiple results in the HyperSearch Results widget/dock 2. Search for something using HyperSearch 3. Search for something different (using HS) 4. Right-click the first result, select "Redo HyperSearch" (just renamed in SVN) RESULT: The title of the second search gets used, but it should be the same as for the first one.
