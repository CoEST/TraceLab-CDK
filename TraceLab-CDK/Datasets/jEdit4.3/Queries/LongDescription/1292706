The size of the open/save dialog is incorrectly calculated/restored when the dialog is displayed on the second display on a dual display system (Windows XP). Basically, if the dialog opens on the secondary display, then the previous size and position is lost. Here are the tests I have performed to explore the behaviour. If the dialog appears on the primary display, the width is correctly calculated/restore from previous settings. If the adjustments are made (with the dialog still on the primary display) then these are correctly restored on next opening of the dialog. This is the behaviour I would expect. If the dialog appears on the secondary display, previous size and position settings are lost. I think that the width of the dialog is being determined by the minimum width of the tree component in the dialog. (See attachment). Any resizing of the dialog (with the dialog still on the secondary display) is lost the next time it is open. This is abnormal behaviour. If the dialog is opened on the secondary display, resized and dragged it to the primary display. The size and position settings are restored on next open.
