If I create a new buffer and immediately close it, or add text but delete it all, and then try to close the buffer, jEdit asks me if I would like to save the empty buffer. I've used other editors before, like notepad, for example, that doesn't ask you to save if the buffer is empty. That's not to say that you can't save an empty buffer, it just would require you to initiate the save command on your own. Frequently, I create new buffers, paste text into it, modify it, and cut it all to the clipboard; using the new buffer only as a temporary space to manipulate some text. In this scenario, I feel it would be beneficial to suppress that alert. What do you all think?
