If all nodes got removed from HyperSearch Results, either manually or with the clear button, the dockable should hide, because you have no benefit from it anymore until you do a new search which brings it up automatically. Sorry if this is a dupe, but I have many bugs to post and am too lazy to check them all for dupes currently. :-) OS: Windows XP Java Version: Sun Java 1.5.0_09-b03 jEdit Version: 4.3pre8
