JEditTextArea processes keyboard input that is not meant for it. e. g. if focus is on Activity Log Dockable or Java Insight Dockable, pressing Del-key deletes characters from the buffer. Sorry if this is a dupe, but I have many bugs to post and am too lazy to check them all for dupes currently. :-) OS: Windows XP Java Version: Sun Java 1.5.0_09-b03 jEdit Version: 4.3pre8
