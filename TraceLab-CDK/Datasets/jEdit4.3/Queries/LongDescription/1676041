Hi, attached is a small patch, which adds an option to change the behaviour, how the caret jumps to next/previous word. If enabled jEdit treats every "CamelHump" part of a word as a word itself when moving the caret. It does not affect the selection of a whole word with double click or shortcut. The option can be found in the editing option pane. I hope, you like it. 8) bye horst
