I've attached a patch for a new configuration option, "thick caret" (in Global options -> Text area). When selected, this causes the caret to be painted slightly wider than the current default. Personally I believe it makes the caret easier to see (as well as better looking, but that might be because I'm used to it from other editors of course). What's with the -devel mailing list btw? Seems I'm unable to subscribe or send mail to it..
