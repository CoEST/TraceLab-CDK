Reverse regex search was enabled in r13400. But a problem has been found while testing the patch. https://sourceforge.net/support/tracker.php?aid=1923613 Repeating [Find Previous] for ".$" stops at every character. It should stop at every end of non-empty line. In contrast, repeating [Find Next] for "^." stops at every start of non-empty line. "$" looks matching at start position of reverse regex search.
