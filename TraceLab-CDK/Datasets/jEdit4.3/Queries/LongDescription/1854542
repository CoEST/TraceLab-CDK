This is for bug #1519924. I basically just added an anonymous KeyAdapter that responds to the escape key and sets the text field's text back to the current path of the browser. This is done in the VFSBrowser constructor and is only done if the mode is equal to BROWSER, since the escape key is normally set to close the dialog window otherwise.
