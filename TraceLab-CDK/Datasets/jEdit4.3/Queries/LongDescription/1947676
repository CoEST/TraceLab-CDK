It would be useful to see the search string in the HyperSearch Results dockable, possibly as part of the label at the top, both if results were found or not. Currently, during search, it just specifies "Searching ..." (and also the file being currently searched), and when the search is over it just specifies "Done" or "Not found". It would be useful to see the search string as part of the label as well (possibly truncated to some logical width).
