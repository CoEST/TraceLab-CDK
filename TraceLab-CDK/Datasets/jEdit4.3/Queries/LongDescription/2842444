So there is the maximum results option that prompts you to stop or continue a HyperSearch, but it would be nice to have a manual stop button for that purpose. This patch does just that. A stop button is added using the default set of icons to the HyperSearch pane (next to highlight, clear, and multi-results buttons). IT is disabled when there is no search currently active, and enabled otherwise. To stop it I basically the mimicked the max-results mechanism, except I use a temporary property to indicate that the stop button was clicked (not to sure if this is the best way to handle it, but all I could think of and it works just fine).
