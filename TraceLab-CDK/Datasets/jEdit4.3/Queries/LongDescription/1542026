Using the keyboard (characters, or space for checkboxes [return for checkboxes works correctly]) to navigate through the menubar inserts the pressed characters literally in the current buffer if the choice is not a sub-/menu, but an action, even if the pressed character is not anything choosable (e. g. Alt+p -> a) Sorry if this is a dupe, but I have many bugs to post and am too lazy to check them all for dupes currently. :-) OS: Windows XP Java Version: Sun Java 1.5.0_06-b05 jEdit Version: SVN Revision 6684 (4.3pre7)
