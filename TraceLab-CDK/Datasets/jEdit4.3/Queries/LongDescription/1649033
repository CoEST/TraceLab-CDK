After choosing the directory to search via [Choose...] button in [Search And Replace] dialog, the view is focused and [Search And Replace] dialog becomes inactive. I can't find the way to set focus back using keyboard. So I'm forced to use the mouse. Keyboard shortcut for action 'find' brings [Search And Replace] dialog up. But then, all settings are reset. This patch will solve the above problem. I would like to work with less use of the mouse, don't you?
