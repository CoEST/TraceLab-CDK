The optionspanes (general and plugins) should be embedded into a JScrollPane, so that the dialog stays at the size the user had chosen and doesn't resize always just because a settings pane is shown that needs more space. For some the settings panes are so huge, that the complete dialog doesn't fit on the screen anymore. Sorry if this is a dupe, but I have many bugs to post and am too lazy to check them all for dupes currently. :-) OS: Windows XP Java Version: Sun Java 1.5.0_09-b03 jEdit Version: 4.3pre8
