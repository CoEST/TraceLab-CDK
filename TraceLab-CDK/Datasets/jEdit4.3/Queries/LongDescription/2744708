Unchanged, but deleted files are not appearing as dirty buffers as they did previously. Steps to reproduce: Create a file and save it. Now delete the file through normal OS methods. Go back to jEdit - you get the "File changed on disk" dialog. Click "close". Notice that the buffer is not marked dirty. Everything behaves as if it is non-existent on the filesystem - eg. Saving the file at this point brings up the file dialog to chose the save location. The buffer is just not marked as dirty as it was in previous versions.
