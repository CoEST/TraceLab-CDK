This is my first patch submission, so I apologize if I'm not following standard customs. I was able to replicate this behavior on Mac OS X Leopard, but only when changing the "Always show search bar" checkbox in Global Options after startup. The corresponding state within the SearchBar object (previously stored in private member 'temp') wasn't being updated after pressing either Apply or OK from the Global Options dialog. It looks like the state of the checkbox was being followed only upon startup. So, here are the changes that I've tried and which I'm submitting as a patch: 1) Renamed SearchBar.temp to 'isRemovable' to better describe what it's supposed to be storing. 2) Moved much of the code that was previously in SearchBar.propertiesChanged() to a new private method, SearchBar.setCloseButtonVisibility(). This is because the SearchBar constructor was calling propertiesChanged() but the properties may not have been changed. 3) In the View class, moved the invocation of searchBar.propertiesChanged() so that it's called regardless of whether the "Always show search bar" is checked or not. The previous version updated the Search Bar's state only if the check box is checked.
