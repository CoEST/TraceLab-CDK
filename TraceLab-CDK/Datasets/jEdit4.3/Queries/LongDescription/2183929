Tested against jEdit 4.3pre16 (r13908) Instead of being ordered by filename, the buffer switcher is ordered by when the files were opened. To reproduce: Use touch to create two files in the same directory: foo.txt and bar.txt Set "Sort buffer sets" to On. Set "Sort buffer sets by filename, instead of pathname" to On. Open foo.txt in jEdit. Then open bar.txt in jEdit. Check the buffer switcher. Foo.txt is shown above bar.txt. This is true for the current view, and any new views (View->New View) that you then create. If you close jEdit then open it again, the switcher is ordered correctly (i.e. bar.txt then foo.txt)
