This is probably the exact same bug as http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1325352&group_id=588&atid=100588 (Context menu and 'Select all'), but I open a new bug as that one was automatically closed almost 2 years ago. Summary: Select all (Ctrl+A), then right-click in the selection (as if to copy, or cut). About one in 3 or 4 times, I lose the selection.
