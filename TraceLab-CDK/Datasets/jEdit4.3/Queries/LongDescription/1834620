Capturing groups above $9 can't be accessed in jEdit 4.2final. For example... Input text: 123456789abc Search regex: ^(1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7)(8)(9)(a)(b)(c)$ Replace regex: $1$2$3$4$5$6$7$8$9$10$11$12 Expected output: 123456789abc Actual output: 123456789101112 It seems the lexer only reads in the first digit following the dollar sign and treats the second digit as plain text.
