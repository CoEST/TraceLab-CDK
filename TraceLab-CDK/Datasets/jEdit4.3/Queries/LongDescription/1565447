HyperSearch reports the number of lines containing one or more instances of a string, not the number of occurrences of the string in the file. Enter two or more identical strings on a single line. Select one of the strings, then HyperSearch. The occurrence count will show 1, not the actual number of strings in the file. jEdit 4.2final Windows 2000 SP4 JRE 5.0 update 8
