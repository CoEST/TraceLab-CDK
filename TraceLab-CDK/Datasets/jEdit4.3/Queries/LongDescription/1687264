This is a followup for the patch #1646058 which enabled removing a node in HyperSearchResults with [Delete] key. If [Delete] key is pressed for empty HyperSearchResults, an exception is shown in the Activity Log. However, it seems no effect except for the log. This patch will fix the above problem.
