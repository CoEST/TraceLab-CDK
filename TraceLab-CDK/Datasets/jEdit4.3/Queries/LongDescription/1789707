Hello, attached patch is for org/gjt/sp/jedit/io/XMLEncodingDetector.java (Revision 10456) The function Charset.isSupported() does not return false if an unsupported encoding is given but throws an IllegalCharsetNameException. Therefore it is not possible to open files with a wrong/unsupported encoding or use hypersearch in directories that contain such files. The bug can be reproduced by creating a file with the following line in it: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="{@CHARSET}"?> (this is part of a template file from wotlab burning board 3) The fix catches this exception, adds a message to the log and returns null. Greetings Andre
