With this patch it is possible to edit the entries in the HistoryText by clicking on "Previously entered strings:" A simple table appears and the history entries can be changed by clicking: Move: PgUp/PgDown; Edit: Double-Click or Insert/Delete. The new class ListModelEditor is not only limited to HistoryText. It can be used to edit any DefaultListModel.
