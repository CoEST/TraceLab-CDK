Hello All, Attached file showcases a bug with the PHP syntax highlighting. The syntax highlighting messes up for me with the first escaped quote in the javascript embedded in the PHP echo statement on line 7 and stays messed up until the closing parenthesis on line 25. As of SVN revision 8320, I can recreate this on a full "native install" (dist) on a Mac 10.4.8, Intel Core Duo. Kevin
