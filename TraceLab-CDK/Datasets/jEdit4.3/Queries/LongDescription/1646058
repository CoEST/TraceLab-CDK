This patch will improve some keyboard interaction in the [HyperSearch Results] tree. * Two flavors [Space], [Enter] to open the node. Pressing [Space] opens the selected node without changing the focus. (The focus remains on the [HyperSearch Results] tree.) Pressing [Enter] opens the selected node and set the focus to the textArea. Without this patch, the latter requires 3 strokes [Enter]+[Ctrl+E]+[Ctrl+J]. * Enable [Delete] key to remove the node. Without this patch, removing nodes can be done only with mouse (context menu). I also implemented adjusting the selection on removal so that repeating some removals behave naturally. P.S. I found the two flavors to open buffers in the macro Files/Buffer_Switcher.bsh. I like this interface very much. I would like to see this interface in all tree or list interface about buffers in jEdit. ErrorList, ProjectViewer and Sidekick are in mind. If you like this patch, I'll try to implement this interface for these plugins.
