[cut 'n' pasted from slava on jedit-devel] Hi, I found a way to reproduce an obscure rectangular selection bug that I've been seeing recently. Create a new buffer, set the wrap margin to 64, enable soft wrap, and paste these two lines (hopefully my mail client won't break them) [ { 0 0 } ] [ 0 0 } "doc" get T{ one-word-elt } prev-elt ] unit-test [ { 0 0 } ] [ 2 0 } "doc" get T{ one-word-elt } prev-elt ] unit-test Now position the cursor after the second "[", and C+drag a one-column vertical selection. What actually happens is the selection extends a few characters to the right, even though you are dragging straight down. Does anybody feel like taking a look at this? Slava
