Warning when a buffer is beeing reloaded is wise as a general rule, but sometimes there are files you're editing that you *know* will change. Typical examples are: - system log files - reports of unit tests Then it would be useful to have these buffers beeing reloaded without beeing prompted. A trivial though not ideal solution would be to add a 4th option "autmatic reload, no confirmation" to the saving global option. A better solution would be to provide a per-buffer option, e.g. "don't prompt when reloading" It would also be very useful, at least to me, to turn off this prompt in a macro, that is, if this option was available in the bean shell
