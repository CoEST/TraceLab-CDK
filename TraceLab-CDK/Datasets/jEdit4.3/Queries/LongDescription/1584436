I edit larger texts with soft wrap turned on. If I cut a text fragment that is larger then the text view, and then move back to the beginning of the text buffer by using the cursor keys, Page-Up or Ctrl-Home, I usually get a NullPointerException. Steps to reproduce: - load http://www.jedit.org/users-guide/starting.html - set buffer line wrap = soft, wrap at 80 characters - cut lines 5 to 45 - press Ctrl-Home This results in a BeanShell error dialog. The beginning of the text buffer is then missing in the display. I have attached a log of the exception. I have confirmed this error in jEdit 4.3pre7, 4.3pre6, and 4.3pre3. This works fine in 4.3pre2. I could not test it in 4.3pre1 due to another bug involving soft wrap.
