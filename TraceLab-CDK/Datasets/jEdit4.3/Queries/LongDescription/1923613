I have implemented support for reverse searching with regular expressions. This works by searching in the forward direction and accepting the last match prior to the current match. Thus it's functional for small-to-moderate sized buffers, but not too efficient for very large buffers. Since I think most folks are using jEdit for source editing, not grepping massive log files, I'm hoping this is an acceptable tradeoff.
