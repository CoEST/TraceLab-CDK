In the current SVN version (4.3pre8), the Filter does not seem to have any effect. New globs are added to the history only when pressing Enter, but don't influence the files shown. When the "filter by current buffer extension" option is set, the files are filtered, but the filter glob is not shown. I think it would also be good to be able to set/unset this option directly in the dialog.
