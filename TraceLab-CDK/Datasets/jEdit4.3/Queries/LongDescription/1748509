From ManagePanel, we need another button "Save" which pops up a file save dialog and lets you save the list of currently installed plugins to an .xml file. If you save it as "default.xml", the InstallPanel will load it automatically when it is displayed, and select those plugins as candidates to install (if they're not installed already). On the InstallPanel, we need a button "Load" which pops up a file load dialog in the same place, and lets you load the .xml file. When it's loaded, any plugin that is not installed but is on that lists gets a checkbox in the install menu.
