Version 4.3pre5, seen on Windows as well as FreeBSD, JDK1.5 If I have 2 views open and both have the same file active(eg foo.txt, line 20 in view 1, line 50 in view 2), then I switch to a different buffer in one of the views (switch view 1 to bar.txt), when that view switches back to foo.txt, it's caret/display placement is the same as the other view (ie, before switching to bar.txt, the caret was on line 20, now it is on line 50, where the other view is located as well.)
