When you do "Find" or "Find and Replace" or "Replace All" with the regular expression "$" (match end of line), 4.3pre6 just hangs while its memory-usage meter thing in the bottom-right-hand-side of its status bar shows memory usage increasing exponentially! Also, this happens regardless of whether the search is performed within a selection, the current buffer, all buffers, or within a directory. To reproduce this bug: 1. Make a new buffer with this content: foo bar baz 2. Select all the text (C-a) 3. Open search&replace dialog (C-f) 4. Type the following regexp in the "search for" field: $ 5. Enable the "regular expressions" check-box (A-x) 7. Press the "Find" or "Find and Replace" or "Replace All" button. 8. Observe that jEdit now hangs, and its memory usage is rapidly increasing (look at memory usage stats at bottom-right-hand-corner of status bar). The expected result is that jEdit should NOT hang and the search should be performed correctly. Thanks for your attention.
