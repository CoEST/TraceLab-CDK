It would be a big increase in usability if the terms searched for were highlighted in the lines displayed in the hypersearch results window and the lines were colored for type (e.g. comments in "comment" color). When there are a lot of results, and the terms are only part of each line, it can be difficult to find the relevant ones. For example: I might search for the term "boolean" but I'm not interested in any cases where it appears in a comment, or where it's part of a method name. So instead of: public boolean doIt() { public void booleanChecker(int boolVal) { this appears in a multi-line comment about booleans I would see (excuse the HTML code): public <font style="color: BLUE;">boolean</font> doIt() { public void <font style="color: BLUE;">boolean</font>Checker(int boolVal) { <font style="color: GREEN;">this appears in a multi-line comment about <font style="color: BLUE;">boolean</font>s</font>
