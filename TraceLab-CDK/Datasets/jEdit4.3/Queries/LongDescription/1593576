If autoindenting copies the indentation of last line the indentation should be done the same way it was copied from, e. g. currently if Soft tabs are enabled, always spaces are inserted, even if the previous line is indented with literally tabs or tabs and spaces mixed. The whitespaces should simply be copied from the line that the auto-indenting is taken from. Sorry if this is a dupe, but I have many bugs to post and am too lazy to check them all for dupes currently. :-) OS: Windows XP Java Version: Sun Java 1.5.0_09-b03 jEdit Version: 4.3pre8
