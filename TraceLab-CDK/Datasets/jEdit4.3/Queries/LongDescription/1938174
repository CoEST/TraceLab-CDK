Occasionally, typing rapidly in the filter text box on the Activity Log will cause jEdit to freeze with 100% CPU activity. The problem is caused by the rapid changing of the filter text not happening on the awt event dispatch thread. This patch simply wraps the contents of the FilteredListModel.setFilter method with a runnable that is then called with SwingUtilities.invokeLater. Patch to be applied to org.gjt.sp.jedit.gui.FilteredListModel.java. Patch created against revision 12387.
