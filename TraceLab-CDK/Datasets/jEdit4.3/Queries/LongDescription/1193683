Hi, when you have some folded text (folding closed) {{{ test aaaa bbbb cccc }}} Close it you'll get {{{ test [4 lines] Delete one { You'll have {{ test and no text fold anymore. It seems really dangerous isn't it ? But the weird thing is that the text is not completely lost because you can type another { (no need to undo) and the fold will reappear magically. So the text was still here but hidden by jEdit's text area
