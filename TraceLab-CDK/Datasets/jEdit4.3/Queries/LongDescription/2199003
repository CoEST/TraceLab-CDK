When there are many plugins installed, there are usually also many dockables available. The Docking option pane in the Global Options dialog shows the entire list of dockables, ordered by their titles. There are two issues with this: 1. Sometimes, dockables from different plugins have the same title (e.g. "Tag List" exists both in Tags and in CtagsInterface, and soon also in Source Navigator), and it is therefore impossible to know which dockable I'm configuring - the one from Tags or the one from CtagsInterface. 2. The list of dockables becomes long, making it less convenient to configure the desired dockables. To solve these issues, the Docking option pane should have a combo-box for choosing the set of dockables to present in the table, similar to the combo-box in the Shortcuts option pane, so that the user can choose to configure the dockables of a specific plugin, or the core, or all, if desired.
