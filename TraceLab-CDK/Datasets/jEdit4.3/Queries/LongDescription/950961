Here is the example text folded using explicit folding: 1| //{{{ 2| Folding 3| Test 4| Case 5| //}}} 6| Other text which folds to: 1| //{{{ [4 lines] 6| Other text By placing the caret after the last brace and pressing return we get the following result: 1| //{{{ 2| New text entered 7| Other text In the editor the fold is now showen as unfolded, but the text within the fold is not displayed. To display the contents of the fold you have to close the fold and open it again which then would display the expected text: 1| //{{{ 2| New text entered 3| Folding 4| Test 5| Case 6| //}}} 7| Other text This error appears to exist with any folding plugin, not just explicit folding. Secondly, with explict folding only, placing the caret between the braces that make up the start of the fold whilst folded and pressing return causes the fold to be 'lost'. As in the space taken up by the fold is still indicated by jEdit but the fold is no longer displayed: 1| //{{ 2| ^{ 7| Other text There are three ways to get the fold back. 1) Delete the new line and whitespace entered. This returns the fold in a closed position 2) Add new braces to complete the fold marker. This adds the fold in an open position but without the origenal text displayed. Closing and reopening the fold corrects this, the same as the first bug. 3) Reopen the file KeeperOfTheSoul <ex@dynafus.com>
