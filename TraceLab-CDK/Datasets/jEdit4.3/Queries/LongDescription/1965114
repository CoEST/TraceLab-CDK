Pressing 'n' with the file system browser dockable open, and the file list focused, opens a new file. This is really annoying, because it makes keyboard completion useless. If I want to open a new file, I can just press C+n. With this "feature" (clearly added by someone not familiar with jEdit's features) I cannot complete filenames by typing them.
